<h3>Early Years</h3>
<p>In 2005, Audi announced that the name of the successful Audi R8 race car would be used for a new road car in 2007, the Audi R8, based on the Audi Le Mans quattro idea car, appearing at the 2003 International Geneva Motor Show, and 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show. The R8 development program began in 2004, Lamberty's design being approved and frozen for production. Production body early models began field testing in January 2006. The R8 road car was officially launched at the Paris Auto Show on 30 September 2006. There was some confusion with the name, which the car shares with the 24 Hours of Le Mans winning R8 Le Mans Early model. 6-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Jacky Ickx described the R8 as the best handling road car today.</p>

<h3>Racing</h3>
<p>By completing the first 25 laps Allan McNish became the 2000 American Le Mans Series LMP Drivers' Champion. McNish and teammate Rinaldo Capello completed 225 laps in their Audi Sport North America R8. Australian driver Brad Jones had also qualified the R8 but did not drive in the race. Jones, the team owner and lead driver of Audi's factory backed Super Touring team in Australia, was on stand-by for Scotsman McNish who had hurt his back a few days before the race while stepping out of his Kilt after a photo shoot and had spent the day before the race flat on his back in bed in a successful effort to be fit to race. The Audi team suffered a set back on the morning of the race when Capello crashed the R8 into the tyre (things that block or stop other things) on the outside of turn six. However the team were able to repair the car to allow McNish to start.
