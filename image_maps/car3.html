<h3>Early Years</h3>
<p>The Nissan GT-R is a 2-door 2+2 high performance vehicle produced by Nissan uncovered and showed off in 2007. It is the (person or thing that comes after something else) to the Nissan Skyline GT-R although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, the name having been given over to the R35 Series and having since left its racing roots. Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be famous for Nissan[5][6] and (accomplished or gained with effort) much fame and success on both road and track. The Nissan GT-R, now a standalone model no longer based on the Skyline, has history in the Nissan Skyline GT-R.

</p>

<h3>Racing</h3>
<p>The first cars named "Skyline GT-R" were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and enjoyed famous success in local Japanese touring car racing. This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973. After a 16-year pause, the GT-R name was (brought back to life) in 1989 as the BNR32 Skyline GT-R. This model GT-R went ahead/moved forward to win the Japanese JTCC Group A series championship four years in a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship helping the R31 Skyline GTS-R to victory in 1990 and winning alone in 1991 and 1992, until a regulation change left out/kept out the GT-R in 1993.</p>
