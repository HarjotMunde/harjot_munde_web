    <h1>Who am I</h1>
    <p>My name is Harjot and I was born in India on July 12, 2001. I moved to Canada at the age of 11 and I have learned a lot more than I could have learned in India. One of important things I was able to learn was English. English is used all over the
        world and if I got to any country and do not know the language I will able to communicate in english. All of this couldn't have happened without my parents so a big thanks to them.</p>

    <h1>What do I love</h1>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>My Family</li>
        <li>Video Games (Call of duty)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A. I really love my family because when we moved to Canada we were going through rough time. My parents had hard time finding jobs which just caused stress. I was old enough to understand what really was going on so just like every other kid I wanted
        toys and bunch of random things. They did get me what I wanted even though we going through hard time and now in future I want to make so much money. Because I want to give my parents everything and do want to give a chance to them to say that
        "oh we can't get that." Now parents have good jobs and they let me get whatevr I want and also my sister buy me games, games, food and other things.</b>

    <p>B. Video games is my weakness specially Call of duty and that too playing with friends everything is over. There was a time I was really into video games which ended up giving me glasses. Call of duty is m favourite game of all time because when I
        met my cousin in Canada that was the first game I played. Cod have level up an dspecial unlocks which keeps the game intersting. Cod black ops 2 was the game that made me make 12 accounts because once I have prestiged the account I don't want
        to be bored. Gta is my second favourite and I have been playing when I was 8yrs old. Driving cars is something I like and when it comes to games you can do anything you want and gta is a game based on real life objects and one thing we can only
        kill people in games not in reality. </p>
